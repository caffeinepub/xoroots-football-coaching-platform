  "summary": "PostAttachmentRenderer was updated to render image attachments inline via <img> (including when MIME is application/octet-stream but filename looks like an image) and to present non-image attachments (video, PDF, and fallback types) as external links opening in a new tab via the direct blob URL. One part of the fallback link is truncated, so compliance for target/rel in that specific branch can’t be fully verified from the provided diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "For any non-image type, the UI shows an external open/download link that opens in a new tab/window with target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\".",
      "reason": "The fallback (unknown file types) anchor tag is truncated in the diff right after `target=\"_blank`, so it’s not possible to confirm from the provided evidence that the full target/rel attributes are correctly present for that branch.",
