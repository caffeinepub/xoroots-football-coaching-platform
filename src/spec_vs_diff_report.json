  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented: Header uses BrandLogo in a left-aligned flex group, and an authenticated-only, non-interactive animated watermark layer is added behind dashboard content. REQ-3 is only partially met because the scrolling background references a hardcoded asset path in CSS rather than the centralized BRANDING.logo.src (and the new background component imports BRANDING but does not use it). The diff summary also indicates several unrelated UI/feature changes not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The scrolling background image is hardcoded in CSS to `/assets/generated/xoroots-logo.dim_300x100.png`, and the added AuthenticatedScrollingLogoBackground component imports BRANDING but does not use it, so the background is not clearly driven by BRANDING.logo.src as required.",
